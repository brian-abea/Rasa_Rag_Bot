2. Process Lifecycle
Throughout the loan servicing period, Customers may reach out to Watu for various reasons, including providing feedback, reporting issues, or submitting complaints.
* Feedback: General comments, suggestions, or opinions about Watu's products, services, or processes.
* Issues: Problems or matters that Customers encounter and require assistance to resolve. These may include technical difficulties, account discrepancies, or service interruptions.
* Complaints: Formal expressions of dissatisfaction with Watu's products, services, or employee conduct.
This section outlines the key steps of the Customer communication handling process, which focuses on addressing complaints and issues. The process is designed to ensure that Customer feedback, issues, and complaints are effectively received, thoroughly investigated, and used to develop appropriate corrective and preventive action plans.
  

Customers can submit their communications through multiple channels, including:
* Calling Watu's provided phone numbers.
* Visiting a Watu Branch office in person.
* Interacting with the Sales team.
When a Customer contacts Watu, the initial interaction aims to address their feedback, resolve their issue, or handle their complaint during the call/interaction. If the matter can be resolved immediately by providing information, clarification, or taking simple actions, the interaction will be concluded. However, if the issue or complaint is technical, complex, or requires further investigation, it will be forwarded to the responsible team or department that handles the process for addressing such matters.
The most common types of Customer complaints and issues include, but are not limited to:
* Loan Repayment: Queries or issues related to making payments, payments to incorrect accounts, missing payment confirmations, phone number changes, deceased Customer cases, and other related matters.
* Asset Ownership Transfer: Inquiries and issues related to logbooks and number plates.
* Mechanical Issues: Problems with asset repairs, GPS tracker malfunctions or replacements.
* Asset Recovery: Complaints regarding returned, repossessed, or recovered assets.
* Accident and Theft: Cases involving assets under police custody, insurance claims, or missing rider gear (helmets, reflective jackets).
* Vandalism: Instances of vandalism occurring externally or on Watu premises.
* Fraud and Customer-Rider Issues: Cases involving fraud or disputes between Customers and riders.

Hi All. With the help of Omar and Maureen, we're putting together the Customer Complaints Management process. Please review (or assign the responsible person to review) in relation to your countries. The specific issue resolution would be described separately as there are many variations. We're starting to work on that document as well and I will share that soon. This one is specific to the steps we go through when handling complaint/feedback
